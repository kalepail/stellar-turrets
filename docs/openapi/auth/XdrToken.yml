name: Turret XDR Token
description: >
  The Turret XDR Token is a signed transaction envelope XDR that is signed by the account seeking authentication's public key.
  The signed XDR, or XDR Token, is provided as a Authorization Bearer token to the Turret.

  ### Xdr Token Structure

  The Xdr Token Transaction is a Stellar transaction that authenticates public key ownership against a Turret.
  It MUST have a Sequence Number of 0 to ensure the transaction is not malicious and is unable to be submitted.
  The following information will be pulled from the Xdr Token Transaction:

  * Sequence Number
    * Verify the sequence number is 0 - if not, reject the token.
  * Source account
    * The account that is paying fees in to the turret through the claimable balance
  * Timebounds
    * The max time of the timebounds will be the absolute UNIX expiration time of the token.
  * Operations
    * ClaimClaimableBalance
      * The Balance Id of the Claimable Fee Balance (of the structure show below) of the fee payment to the turret.
    * ManageData
      * Used to pass token parameters into the turret
      * Valid parameters
        * Entry name = "txFunction" (If no txFunctions parameters are passed in, the turret does not limit any txFunctions to run)
          * Value = the hash of the txFunction that the user is allowing the turret to run
  * Signature
    * The Fee Transaction is signed by the account that is the source account of the transaction
